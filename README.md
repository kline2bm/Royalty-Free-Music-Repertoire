Royalty Free Music Repertoire
This was working on Replit, but now they won't let me edit for free there anymore. I could C+V the uncompressed ZIP, but I'm planning a big overhaul, so I might as well start over here.
When I'm finished, it will be made with HTML, CSS, and JS. It will collect a bunch of royalty-free music and autoplay them with user controls. It will have a bunch of features including a shell/terminal and sets of related music. Some of my own music files will be included.
